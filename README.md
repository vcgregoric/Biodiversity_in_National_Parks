## Overview
The work in this repository was completed as the final project of the Data Science Foundations Skill Path on Codecademy.com. This was an open-ended project with the overall goal of practicing data cleanup, analysis, and visualization. Codecademy.com provided the data, but it was up to me to determine the direction of the project. The data is focused on the plants and animals found in four US national parks. For each species in this study, the dataset includes the scientific name, common names, species category, conservation status, and the number of observations in each park over the course of one week. 

## File Structure
This project contains the following files:
- **biodiversity.ipynb:** The main analysis file, written using Jupyter notebook
- **species_info.csv:** A dataset containing descriptive information about each species in this study
- **observations.csv:** A dataset containing information about the number of times each species was observed at each park
- **summary_slides.pdf:** A slide deck summarizing the resutls of this project
- **README.md:** This file, containing an overivew of the project
